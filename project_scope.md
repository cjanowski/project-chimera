# Project Scope Document for Project Chimera - Finalized

## Project Title
"Project Chimera: Building a Small-Scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Language Model"

## Objective and Goals
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for a language model. The goals include demonstrating advanced neural network techniques to improve efficiency and scalability compared to traditional dense transformers, as well as contributing to the field of efficient large-scale language models.

## Scope
1. **Research and Development**
   - Investigate existing MoE architectures, including Mixtral and Google's Switch Transformer.
   - Develop a comprehensive understanding of the routing mechanisms and their implications for model performance.

2. **Implementation**
   - Implement a standard "nano-GPT" style Transformer decoder block in PyTorch.
   - Design and implement an MoE layer consisting of expert networks and a gating network.
   - Integrate the MoE layer into the Transformer block.

3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Train the MoE model on a curated dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance against a dense transformer model with similar computational costs.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**
   - Analyze the results, focusing on training loss and inference speed.
   - Prepare a final report summarizing findings, insights, and future work.

## Deliverables
- Summary of key insights from research on MoE architectures.
- Implementation of the MoE model and associated components.
- Training results and performance comparison with dense models.
- Final project report and presentation.

## Success Metrics
- **Model Performance:**
  - Achieve a training loss lower than that of a comparable dense model.
  - Maintain inference speed that is competitive with dense architectures.

- **Scalability:**
  - Demonstrate the ability to scale the model effectively with increased parameters while managing computational costs.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Show a reduction in the number of active parameters during inference compared to standard transformers.

- **Documentation:**
  - Provide comprehensive documentation for the implementation and findings to facilitate future research and development.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project aims to push the boundaries of language model architectures by leveraging the Mixture-of-Experts approach. Future work will involve exploring advanced routing mechanisms and their implications for model performance.
